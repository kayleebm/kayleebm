### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Hi, Iâ€™m Kaylee
- Iâ€™m interested in computer engineering
- Iâ€™m currently learning coding/ circuit building
- I'm originally from Hawai'i
- I'm a sophmore in computer engineering
- I chose my major because I one day want to work in department of homeland security
- A fun fact about me is:  I own a lei business @hakuleibykay on instagram
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  More about coding and what kinds of things I can create with it
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  Mean girls (im a regina stan)
